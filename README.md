# Model Evaluation:

 A confusion matrix is a summary of prediction results on a classification problem. The number of correct and incorrect predictions are summarized with count values and broken down by each class

True Positive (TP) : Observation is positive, and is 4544 predicted to be positive.

False Negative (FN) : Observation is positive, but is 354 predicted negative.

True Negative (TN) : Observation is negative, and is 196 predicted to be negative.

False Positive (FP) : Observation is negative, but is 5691 predicted positive.
